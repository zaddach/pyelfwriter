pyelfwriter
===========

This is a very simple library to create ELF files in python.
All other (pyelftools, pydevtools, pylibelf) python ELF 
libraries are much better for reading existing ELF files,
but none of them allows to create an ELF file from scratch.

For usage see test example at the end of the file.
